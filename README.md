# Paint
A simple paint program written in C using OpenGL. The user is able to draw points, lines, rectanges and circles in either preset or random colours.

Right click to bring up the menu.

To begin, select a shape from the Shape menu.

The initial colour is white but five preset colours may be selected from 

the Colour menu.Or click Random Colours to allow each new shape drawn to 

have a random colour. Doing so disables the Colour menu. You must click 

Random Colours again to re-able the Colour menu. You can also reset the 

colour to white by disabling and re-enabling the colour menu.

Radial Paint Brush draws points that are equidistant from the origin and 

equally spaced out.
